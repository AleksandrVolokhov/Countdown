# JS Countdown

Simple and pretty standard Countdown made with JavaScript. A countdown timer is a virtual clock running on a landing page. And it counts down from a certain date to indicate the beginning (or the end) of an event. Countdown timers are used by soon to be live websites as well as many ecommerce websites.

This project is made out of JS, HTML, CSS.
The reason I made this project was just _to practice_ JavaScript.
In order to recreate this project, you will not need anything besides your code editor of choice! I personally use Visual Studio Code.
